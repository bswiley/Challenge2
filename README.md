# Profilio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a simple webpage the html and css I'd recently learned.  Since I would, at some point soon, get full-time employment as a software if not full on web developer, attempting to create a profile page cum portfolio (hence "profilio") to deploy to not only show off some of the web development skills I will have learned but also create a webpage as a point of reference when communicating with others (both other developers and potential employers.  As I created it, however, I quickly discovered that I have a lot of blanks as far as the content is concerned.  When first built I hadn't had any projects to show off (so all the projects were just simple pictures). I also didn't have a good picture to use, lacked many useful social media accounts and made it at a time when my experiences and interests were changing making my resume not applicable for the kind of work I would be searching for usable.  I also lacked design talent and I quickly realized that the color scheme I came up with would not work for a real personal web page.  But since I wasn't ready to add content and rethink the design I made it to play around with what I could do.  This is why there are elements such as cards that turn slightly when they are hovered over, etc.  These are thinks it was good to learn how to do, but in doing a more serious page, I would use a more simple design, probably mainly using a lot of white and black. 

That said, the elements that it has are true.  The project links work and they were projects that I worked on with a group of fellow developers.  I don't know if the 'send email' link will do much, at most maybe pull up the user's email client.  But other than that the links in "Contacts" are all valid and current (as few as there are).

## Installation
This page was [deployed](https://bswiley.github.io/Challenge2/) directly after the work was completed.  In Github, the index.html is at the same level as this README.md file.  I assume it is unlikely anyone would want to download and try and install the site (prefering, at most to just click the links), but it is a simple page and can be cloned locally.  It doesn't use any kind of advanced technology, so nothing else has to be installed.  It can just be opened in a browser from the cloned copy.
