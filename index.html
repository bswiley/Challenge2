                <p id="text">Here is where I go on and on about myself, but since I am not quoting Cicero's <span>De finibus bonorum et malorum</span>, my text at this point won't last very long.  Not nearly as long as I would like it too.  Certainly, not nearly as long as it probably should be. Although, I should mention that the images below represent some of the projects "I have been working on" recently.  Starting with the first project which is a really big deal and moving on down to my fifth project which probably won't have as much impact.  Naturally, the current images don't themselves have any content because, at this stage all the projects are imaginary and my imagination is rather limited.  I didn't want to copy the images in the model because that would be plagerism and I also couldn't pull put interesting, attention-getting images out of my . . . . well you know, even though had I been able to do so those images would most certainly be more interesting and inspiring.  I claim the same excuse for my profile/avatar picture.</p>
